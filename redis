Redis is an in-memory remote database that offers high performance, replication,
and a unique data model to produce a flatform for solving problems.

Redis is a very fast onn-relational database that stores a mapping of keys to five
different types of values.

Strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets
bulk operations, partial transaction support
Publish/Subscripe
master/slave
disk persistence, scripting(stored procedures)

persistence,
1. point-in-time dump
    certion condition are met(a number of writes in a give period)
    one of the dump-to-disk commands is called
2. append-only
    never sync
    sync once per second
    sync at the completion of every operation

master/slave

STRINGs, LISTs, SETS, HASHs, ZSETs.
DEL, TYPE, RENAME

STRING (strings, integers, floating-point) whole string, parts, increment/decrement the integers and floats

LIST push or pop from both ends, trim based on offsets, read individual or multiple items, find or remove iterms by value

SET Add, fetch, or remove individual items, check membership, intersect, unicon, difference, fetch random items

HASH add, fetch or remove individual items, fetch the whole hash

ZSET(sorted set) Ordered mapping of string members to floating-point scores, ordered by score  add, fetch or remove invidual values, fetch iterms based on score ranges or member value
